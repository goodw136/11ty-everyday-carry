##### Description: A metal Iron Flask water bottle that carries up to 40 ounces of liquid.

### Why I Never Leave Without It: I drink a LOT of water throughout the day, so much so that sometimes I'll have to refill this thing as many as 2-3 times a day. It can be heavy and kind of a pain to carry but it is absolutely worth it to keep hydrated.
